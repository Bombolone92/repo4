## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Option 1: Double-Click (Windows)

1. Download or clone this repo
2. Double-click **`run_server.bat`**
3. Browser opens → start generating!

### Option 2: Command Line

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hassanmsthf11/free-ai-image-generator.git
cd free-ai-image-generator

# Start a local server
python -m http.server 8000

# Open http://localhost:8000/index.html in your browser
```

## 🛠️ Server-Side Examples (Node.js & Python)

Want to use the same models from a script, server, or automation? Two ready-to-run examples are included in the `examples/` folder.

### Node.js

```bash
npm install puter            # or `npm i -g puter && puter signin`
export PUTER_TOKEN=puter-... # get it from https://puter.com/app/settings
node examples/node-example.js "A cyberpunk dragon"
```

The script iterates over the full model lineup (GPT Image 2, FLUX.2 Pro/Flex/Dev, Gemini 3, etc.), saves each result as a PNG.

### Python

```bash
pip install requests
export PUTER_TOKEN=puter-...
python examples/python-example.py "A cyberpunk dragon"
# or run a single model:
python examples/python-example.py "..." --model "FLUX.2 Pro (NEW · photorealism)"
```

Both examples use the same `puter.ai.txt2img` API the browser SDK calls under the hood, so the model identifiers, providers, and parameters are identical.

## 🧠 How Does It Work?

AI Image Studio uses [Puter.js](https://puter.com) to connect your browser directly to powerful AI models — no backend, no API keys, no server required.

```
Your Browser → Puter.js SDK → AI Models (DALL-E, Gemini, FLUX)
                     ↓
              Generated Image → Your Gallery (saved in localStorage)
```

**First time?** A small authentication popup appears and closes automatically in ~1 second. After that, you get unlimited generations — forever.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript (single file, ~50KB) |
| **AI Backend** | [Puter.js](https://puter.com) — serverless AI gateway |
| **Image Storage** | Browser localStorage for gallery history |
| **Server** | Any static file server (Python, Node) or open HTML directly |
| **Node.js example** | Uses the Puter.js Node SDK |
| **Python example** | Uses `requests` against the Puter REST API |
| **Design** | Custom dark theme with Inter font, gradient accents |
